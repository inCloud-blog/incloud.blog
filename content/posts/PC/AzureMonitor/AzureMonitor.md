## Prologue
In this time, in modern IT departments cloud computing and especialy public cloud is something normal. Most of workloads are running in local datacenter but we don’t afraid new posibilities of public cloud - it’s a fact. We know how to build and use environments and how to deliver necessary resources to business need. But do we really have ability to extract and visualize important data from our public cloud environments? Do we know what’s more important - security logs, sys logs or usage/performance data?

In next four articles I’ll try to demonstrate three most popular utilities to collect, visualize and share operational dashboards.

This article is first in this series:

[x] [Azure Monitor](/azuremonitor/)

[ ] [Azure Monitor and grafana integration](/azuremonitor-grafana/)

[ ] [Azure Monitor and Elasticsearch/Kibana](/azuremonitor-elkkibana/)


## Prerequisites

+ Azure Subscription - it can be any type (I'll talk about pricing at the end of this article)
+ Monitored resources with Azure Monitor deployer
+ Some time to configure everything
